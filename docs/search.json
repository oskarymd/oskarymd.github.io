This underscores the multifaceted nature of the Broadway industry, where longevity is one of many contributors to a show’s financial performance.\n\n\nCode\np <- plot_ly(\n  data = tot_show, \n  x = ~Year_Of_Run, \n  y = ~Total_Gross, \n  type = 'scatter', \n  mode = 'markers',\n  color = ~Show, # Color by Show\n  text = ~paste(\"Show:\", Show, \"<br>Historical Total Gross:\", Total_Gross, \"<br>Year of Run:\", Year_Of_Run), # Text to display on hover\n  hoverinfo = \"text\"\n) %>% layout(\n  title = \"Longevity and Success: Total Historical Grosses vs. Years of Run\",\n  xaxis = list(title = \"Year of Run\"),\n  yaxis = list(title = \"Historical Total Gross\"),\n  showlegend = FALSE\n)\n\np"
